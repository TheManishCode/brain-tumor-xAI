    "overview": {
      "definition": "A brain tumor is an abnormal growth of cells in the brain or surrounding tissues. Brain tumors can be benign (non-cancerous) or malignant (cancerous). They are classified as primary (originating in the brain) or secondary/metastatic (spreading from cancer elsewhere in the body).",
      "description": "Brain tumors occur when abnormal cells form within the brain. These tumors can disrupt normal brain function by pressing on or invading healthy brain tissue. They vary widely in their aggressiveness, location, and treatability. Early detection and proper diagnosis are crucial for optimal treatment outcomes.",
      "prevalence": "Brain tumors affect approximately 700,000 people in the United States. About 87,000 new cases are diagnosed annually, with roughly 25,000 being malignant. They can occur at any age but are more common in children and older adults.",

Many patients receive a combination of treatments.",
